## App Architecture
Currently, this app uses MVVM Architecture, which is achieved with a third-party library called PreCompose.

## Libraries
- PreCompose for Viewmodels
- PreCompose for Navigation
- Koin for DI with PreCompose
- Kamel (Not used but if we need to load images from the internet in future versions of the app, we include it)
- SQLDelight 2.0.1 for local storage
- Ktor for API support (please follow https://github.com/gastsail/ktorExpensesApi/tree/master to start the server) also see ExpensesRepoImpl to setup the BASE_URL

## Previews
Previews are only working on the Android side, currently, we include compose preview and compose uiTooling on the build.gradle (:shared) folder only for androidMain.
Then inside *androidApp* we create a preview folder and use the Preview right there. 

Since this is a compose multiplatform project, we can preview only on the Android side, but this is not a blocker since the same view will be shown on iOS.

We can create custom themes for iOS look and feel.
